## Examples

### Why is $0.99999...=1$ true? {-}

Our intuition tells us that
$$
0.\dot{9}\le 1.
$$
Here I will use **Algebra** to show that actually
$$
0.\dot{9}= 1.
$$

**Proof.** Let 
$$
x = 0.\dot{9}.
$$
Then,
$$
\begin{array}{ccl}
10x &=& 10\times 0.\dot{9}\\
&=& 10(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + \cdots)\\
&=& 9 + 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + \cdots\\
&=& 9 + x,
\end{array}
$$
from which it follows that
$$
9x = 9.
$$
So, $x=9/9=1.$ The proof is completed.

**Exercises:**

    (a) Convert $0.\dot{1}$ to a fraction.
    (b) Covert $2.1\dot{2}\dot{3}$ to a fraction.

### How much money can you save? {-}

Like me, if you take a bus and go to the downtown, you probably will see an ads in front of a shop, saying "Buy one and get the second for half price!" Here, a natural question to ask is: How much is the saving?

I guess you can solve the above question in a way. However, trust me, the best way to solve the above problem is using **Algebra** as shown below.

**Solution.** Let the price of the item is $p$. So,
$$
\hbox{the saving} = 2p - (p + 0.5p) = 0.5p.
$$
The percentage saving is
$$
\frac{0.5p}{2p}=0.25=25\%.
$$

### Sum of inner angles of a triangle {-}

We all know that the sum of the three inner angles of a triangle is equal to $180^0$, but why is this true. Below is a simple proof.

**Proof.** Observing the picture below, we have
$$
\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 = 360^0,
$$
and
$$
(\theta_1 + \angle C) + (\theta_2 + \angle A) + (\theta_3 + \angle B) = 540^0.
$$
Thus, it follows from the above two equations that
$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 540^0 - 360^0=180^0.
$$
The proof is completed.

### Average is Between the Min and Max

Let $x_1,\ x_2,\ \ldots,\ x_n$ be $n$ numbers. Let $w_1,\ w_2,\ \ldots,\ w_n$ be $n$ positive numbers such that $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$ (i.e. $w_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$ are the so-called weights, and a special case is $w_1=w_2=\ldots=w_n=1/n$). Let the minimum be
$$
m:=\hbox{min}\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\};
$$
let the maximum be
$$
M:=\hbox{max}\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\},
$$
The following are true.

    (a) $m \le x_i \le M$, for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n.$
    (b) $m\le \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \le M.$
    
Statement (a) is obvious; now we show (b) is true.

**Proof of (b).** Since
$$
m \le x_i, \ \hbox{for}\ i=1, 2, \ldots,  n,
$$
$$
mw_i \le w_ix_i, \ \hbox{for}\ i=1, 2, \ldots,  n.
$$
Thus,
$$
m=\sum_{i=1}^n mw_i\le \sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i.
$$
In the same manner, we can prove
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i \le M.
$$

**Exercise** (kind of challenging). Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ be $n$ arbitrary positive numbers; let $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$ be another $n$ arbitrary positive numbers. Show that
$$
\hbox{min}\{x_1/y_1, x_2/y_2, \ldots, x_n/y_n\}\le \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i} \le \hbox{max}\{x_1/y_1, x_2/y_2, \ldots, x_n/y_n\}.
$$
