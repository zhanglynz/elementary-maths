# Fun Algebra

In my opinion, from **Algebra** we learn two things, namely, (i) how to set up equations, and (ii) how to solve equations. In school, they usually pay more attention to (ii), however, mastering (i)  is very important for real-life problem solving.

When we want to set up equations, we actually translate the statement in a word problem into **algebraic expressions**. The key idea here is to use the letter $x$ to replace the *unknown* (of course, if there are two unknowns, we will use the letters $x$ and $y$).

After the "Knowledge Base" section---which briefly introduces the Algebra points in high school maths---we use a number of examples to show the beauties in (i) and (ii).

## Knowledge Base

In what follows in this section, $x$ is always the *unknown* to be found; $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants and $a\neq 0$ is assumed if this is necessary.

- The solution to 
$$
ax + b=0,
$$
is 
$$
x=-\frac{b}{a}.
$$

- The solution to
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
$$
is 
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},\ \hbox{provided}\ b^2-4ac \ge 0.
$$
NB: This is the so-called **quadratic formula**. To derive the formula, we need to use the "complete square method"; see this as an example in the next section. 

- The purpose for **factorization** is to find roots of an equation, or to simplify an algebraic expression.


## Examples

### How much money can you save? {-}

Like me, if you take a bus and go to the downtown, you probably will see an ads in front of a shop, saying "Buy one and get the second for half price!" Here, a natural question to ask is: How much is the saving?

I guess you can solve the above problem in a way. However, trust me, the best way to solve the above problem is using **Algebra** as shown below.

**Solution.** Let the price of the item be $p$. So,
$$
\hbox{the saving} = 2p - (p + 0.5p) = 0.5p.
$$
The percentage saving is
$$
\frac{0.5p}{2p}=0.25=25\%.
$$




### Why is $0.99999...=1$ true? {-}

Our intuition tells us that
$$
0.\dot{9}\le 1.
$$
Here I will use **Algebra** to show that actually
$$
0.\dot{9}= 1.
$$

**Proof.** Let 
$$
x = 0.\dot{9}.
$$
Then,
$$
\begin{array}{ccl}
10x &=& 10\times 0.\dot{9}\\
&=& 10(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + \cdots)\\
&=& 9 + 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + \cdots\\
&=& 9 + x,
\end{array}
$$
from which it follows that
$$
9x = 9.
$$
So, $x=9/9=1.$ The proof is completed.

**Exercises:**

  (a) Convert $0.\dot{1}$ to a fraction.
  (b) Covert $2.1\dot{2}\dot{3}$ to a fraction.

### The quadratic formula {-}

A general quadratic equation is given by
$$
ax^2+bx+c=0,
$$
where $a\neq 0$. Below is how to derive a formula to solve the equation. The method is called *complet square*.

**Derivation of the quadratic formula.**
$$
\begin{array}{cl}
&ax^2+bx+c=0\\
\Rightarrow & x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{c}{a}=0 \ \ [\hbox{divided by}\ a\ \hbox{on both sides}]\\
\Rightarrow & x^2 + 2\frac{b}{2a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2+\frac{c}{a}=\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\ \ [\hbox{key step!}]\\
\Rightarrow & \left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\
\Rightarrow & x+\frac{b}{2a}=\pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\ \ [\hbox{provided}\ b^2-4ac\ge 0]\\
\Rightarrow & x = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
\end{array}
$$

### Sum of inner angles of a triangle {-}

We all know that the sum of the three inner angles of a triangle is equal to $180^{\circ}$, but why is this true? Below a simple proof answers the question.

**Proof.** Observing the Figure \@ref(fig:trifig) below, we have
$$
\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 = 360^{\circ},
$$
and
$$
(\theta_1 + \angle C) + (\theta_2 + \angle A) + (\theta_3 + \angle B) = 540^{\circ}.
$$
Thus, it follows from the above two equations that
$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 540^{\circ} - 360^{\circ}=180^{\circ}.
$$
The proof is completed.

```


**Exercise:** Suppose that we set a complete turn is $100^{\circ}$ but not $360^{\circ}$ any more. Then, what is the sum of the inner angles of a triangle?

### Average is Between the Min and Max

Let $x_1,\ x_2,\ \ldots,\ x_n$ be $n$ numbers. Let $w_1,\ w_2,\ \ldots,\ w_n$ be $n$ positive numbers such that $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$ (i.e. $w_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$ are the so-called weights, and a special case is $w_1=w_2=\ldots=w_n=1/n$). Let the minimum be
$$
m:=\hbox{min}\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\};
$$
let the maximum be
$$
M:=\hbox{max}\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\},
$$
The following are true.

  (a) $m \le x_i \le M$, for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n.$
  (b) $m\le \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \le M.$
    
Statement a is obvious; now we show b is true.

**Proof of b.** Since
$$
m \le x_i, \ \hbox{for}\ i=1, 2, \ldots,  n,
$$
$$
mw_i \le w_ix_i, \ \hbox{for}\ i=1, 2, \ldots,  n.
$$
Thus,
$$
m=\sum_{i=1}^n mw_i\le \sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i.
$$
In the same manner, we can prove
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i \le M.
$$

**Exercise** (kind of challenging). Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ be $n$ arbitrary positive numbers; let $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$ be another $n$ arbitrary positive numbers. Show that
$$
\hbox{min}\{x_1/y_1, x_2/y_2, \ldots, x_n/y_n\}\le \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i} \le \hbox{max}\{x_1/y_1, x_2/y_2, \ldots, x_n/y_n\}.
$$
