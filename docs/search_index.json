["fun-algebra.html", "1 Fun Algebra 1.1 Knowledge Base 1.2 Examples", " 1 Fun Algebra In my opinion, from Algebra we learn two things, namely, (i) how to set up equations, and (ii) how to solve equations. In school, they usually pay more attention to (ii), however, mastering (i) is very important for real-life problem solving. When we want to set up equations, we actually translate the statement in a word problem into algebraic expressions. The key idea here is to use the letter \\(x\\) to replace the unknown (of course, if there are two unknowns, we will use the letters \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). After the “Knowledge Base” section—which briefly introduces the Algebra points in high school maths—we use a number of examples to show the beauties in (i) and (ii). 1.1 Knowledge Base In what follows in this section, \\(x\\) is always the unknown to be found; \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants and \\(a\\neq 0\\) is assumed if this is necessary. The solution to \\[ ax + b=0, \\] is \\[ x=-\\frac{b}{a}. \\] The solution to \\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0, \\] is \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},\\ \\hbox{provided}\\ b^2-4ac \\ge 0. \\] NB: This is the so-called quadratic formula. To derive the formula, we need to use the “complete square method”; see this as an example in the next section. The purpose for factorization is to find roots of an equation, or to simplify an algebraic expression. 1.2 Examples How much money can you save? Like me, if you take a bus and go to the downtown, you probably will see an ads in front of a shop, saying “Buy one and get the second for half price!” Here, a natural question to ask is: How much is the saving? I guess you can solve the above problem in a way. However, trust me, the best way to solve the above problem is using Algebra as shown below. Solution. Let the price of the item is \\(p\\). So, \\[ \\hbox{the saving} = 2p - (p + 0.5p) = 0.5p. \\] The percentage saving is \\[ \\frac{0.5p}{2p}=0.25=25\\%. \\] Why is \\(0.99999...=1\\) true? Our intuition tells us that \\[ 0.\\dot{9}\\le 1. \\] Here I will use Algebra to show that actually \\[ 0.\\dot{9}= 1. \\] Proof. Let \\[ x = 0.\\dot{9}. \\] Then, \\[ \\begin{array}{ccl} 10x &amp;=&amp; 10\\times 0.\\dot{9}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 10(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + \\cdots)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 9 + 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + \\cdots\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 9 + x, \\end{array} \\] from which it follows that \\[ 9x = 9. \\] So, \\(x=9/9=1.\\) The proof is completed. Exercises: (a) Convert $0.\\dot{1}$ to a fraction. (b) Covert $2.1\\dot{2}\\dot{3}$ to a fraction. The quadratic formula A general quadratic equation is given by \\[ ax^2+bx+c=0, \\] where \\(a\\neq 0\\). Below is how to derive a formula to solve the equation. The method is called complet square. Derivation of the quadratic formula. \\[ \\begin{array}{cl} &amp;ax^2+bx+c=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}=0 \\ \\ [\\hbox{divided by}\\ a\\ \\hbox{on both sides}]\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x^2 + 2\\frac{b}{2a}x + \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2+\\frac{c}{a}=\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2\\ \\ [\\hbox{key step!}]\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; \\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2=\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x+\\frac{b}{2a}=\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\ \\ [\\hbox{provided}\\ b^2-4ac\\ge 0]\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x = \\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{array} \\] "],

Below a simple proof answers the question. Proof. Observing the picture below, we have \\[ \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 + \\theta_3 = 360^0, \\] and \\[ (\\theta_1 + \\angle C) + (\\theta_2 + \\angle A) + (\\theta_3 + \\angle B) = 540^0. \\] Thus, it follows from the above two equations that \\[ \\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 540^0 - 360^0=180^0. \\] The proof is completed. Exercise: Suppose that we set a complete turn is \\(100^0\\) but not \\(360^2\\) any more. Then, what is the sum of the inner angles of a triangle? 2.2 Coordiante Geometry "],
