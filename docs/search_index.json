Our intuition tells us that \\[ 0.\\dot{9}\\le 1. \\] Here I will use Algebra to show that actually \\[ 0.\\dot{9}= 1. \\] Proof. Let \\[ x = 0.\\dot{9}. \\] Then, \\[ \\begin{array}{ccl} 10x &amp;=&amp; 10\\times 0.\\dot{9}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 10(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + \\cdots)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 9 + 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + \\cdots\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 9 + x, \\end{array} \\] from which it follows that \\[ 9x = 9. \\] So, \\(x=9/9=1.\\) The proof is completed. Exercises: Convert \\(0.\\dot{1}\\) to a fraction. Covert \\(2.1\\dot{2}\\dot{3}\\) to a fraction. How much money can you save? Like me, if you take a bus and go to the downtown, you probably will see an ads in front of a shop, saying “Buy one and get the second for half price!” Here, a natural qestion to ask is: How much is the saving? I guess you can solve the above question in a way. However, trust me, the best way to solve the above problem is usig Algebra as shown below. Solution. Let the price of the item is \\(p\\). So, \\[ \\hbox{the saving} = 2p - (p + 0.5p) = 0.5p. \\] The percentage saving is \\[ \\frac{0.5p}{2p}=0.25=25\\%. \\] "],
