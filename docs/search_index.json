["fun-algebra.html", "1 Fun Algebra 1.1 Knowledge Base 1.2 Examples", " 1 Fun Algebra In my opinion, from Algebra we learn two things, namely, (i) how to set up equations, and (ii) how to solve equations. In school, they usually pay more attention to (ii), however, mastering (i) is very important for real-life problem solving. When we want to set up equations, we actually translate the statement in a word problem into algebraic expressions. The key idea here is to use the letter \\(x\\) to replace the unknown (of course, if there are two unknowns, we will use the letters \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). After the “Knowledge Base” section—which briefly introduces the Algebra points in high school maths—we use a number of examples to show the beauties in (i) and (ii). 1.1 Knowledge Base In what follows in this section, \\(x\\) is always the unknown to be found; \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants and \\(a\\neq 0\\) is assumed if this is necessary. The solution to \\[ ax + b=0, \\] is \\[ x=-\\frac{b}{a}. \\] The solution to \\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0, \\] is \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},\\ \\hbox{provided}\\ b^2-4ac \\ge 0. \\] NB: This is the so-called quadratic formula. To derive the formula, we need to use the “complete square method”; see this as an example in the next section. The purpose for factorization is to find roots of an equation, or to simplify an algebraic expression. 1.2 Examples How much money can you save? Like me, if you take a bus and go to the downtown, you probably will see an ads in front of a shop, saying “Buy one and get the second for half price!” Here, a natural question to ask is: How much is the saving? I guess you can solve the above problem in a way. However, trust me, the best way to solve the above problem is using Algebra as shown below. Solution. Let the price of the item be \\(p\\). So, \\[ \\hbox{the saving} = 2p - (p + 0.5p) = 0.5p. \\] The percentage saving is \\[ \\frac{0.5p}{2p}=0.25=25\\%. \\] Why is \\(0.99999...=1\\) true? Our intuition tells us that \\[ 0.\\dot{9}\\le 1. \\] Here I will use Algebra to show that actually \\[ 0.\\dot{9}= 1. \\] Proof. Let \\[ x = 0.\\dot{9}. \\] Then, \\[ \\begin{array}{ccl} 10x &amp;=&amp; 10\\times 0.\\dot{9}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 10(0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + \\cdots)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 9 + 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + \\cdots\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 9 + x, \\end{array} \\] from which it follows that \\[ 9x = 9. \\] So, \\(x=9/9=1.\\) The proof is completed. Exercises: Convert \\(0.\\dot{1}\\) to a fraction. Covert \\(2.1\\dot{2}\\dot{3}\\) to a fraction. The quadratic formula A general quadratic equation is given by \\[ ax^2+bx+c=0, \\] where \\(a\\neq 0\\). Below is how to derive a formula to solve the equation. The method is called complet square. Derivation of the quadratic formula. \\[ \\begin{array}{cl} &amp;ax^2+bx+c=0\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}=0 \\ \\ [\\hbox{divided by}\\ a\\ \\hbox{on both sides}]\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x^2 + 2\\frac{b}{2a}x + \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2+\\frac{c}{a}=\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2\\ \\ [\\hbox{key step!}]\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; \\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2=\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x+\\frac{b}{2a}=\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\ \\ [\\hbox{provided}\\ b^2-4ac\\ge 0]\\\\ \\Rightarrow &amp; x = \\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{array} \\] Find a continued fraction What is the following number \\[ 2 + \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{2+\\cdots}}}}? \\] This is an interesting problem. I only know one way to solve it—using Algebra. Solution. Let \\(x\\) be the number. We have \\[\\begin{equation} 2 + \\frac{1}{x} = x, \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] Solving (1.1), we get \\[ x = 1 + \\sqrt{2}\\ \\hbox{or}\\ x = 1 - \\sqrt{2}. \\] Since \\(x\\) must be positive, we only keep \\(x=1+\\sqrt{2}\\).

Below a simple proof answers the question. Proof. Observing the Figure 2.1 below, we have \\[ \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 + \\theta_3 = 360^{\\circ}, \\] and \\[ (\\theta_1 + \\angle C) + (\\theta_2 + \\angle A) + (\\theta_3 + \\angle B) = 540^{\\circ}. \\] Thus, it follows from the above two equations that \\[ \\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 540^{\\circ} - 360^{\\circ}=180^{\\circ}. \\] The proof is completed. Figure 2.1: A triangle. Exercise: Suppose that we set a complete turn is \\(100^{\\circ}\\) but not \\(360^{\\circ}\\) any more. Then, what is the sum of the inner angles of a triangle? The Pythagorean Theorem (TPT) TPT: For any a right triangle, let \\(c\\) be the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side), let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be the lengths of the other two sides. It’s true that \\[ a^2+b^2=c^2. \\] Remark: The book, The Pythagorean Theorem, written by Eli Maor, is all about the Theorem. According to this book, there are about 400 known proofs of the theorem. Below is an elegant proof and I like it the best. Proof of TPT: The key is to construct the following diagram Figure 2.2: Key diagram. So, we have the following equality: The area of the “big square” is the same as the area of the “four right triangles” plus the area of the “small square”. That is, \\[ (a+b)^2 = 4(1/2)ab + c^2, \\] which implies \\[\\begin{equation} a^2+b^2+2ab=2ab + c^2 \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Cancelling the term \\(2ab\\) from the both sides of (2.1), we get \\[ a^2+b^2=c^2. \\] The law of cosines For any a triangle \\(ABC\\), it is true that \\[\\begin{equation} c^2= a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos C, \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the sides that opposite to angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), respectively. Proof: We distinguish three cases. Case 1: \\(C=90^{\\circ}\\). In this case, the right hand side of Equation (2.2) is \\[ a^2 + b^2 \\] which equals \\(c^2\\)—the left hand side—according to The Pythagorean Theorem (TPT). Case 2: \\(C&gt;90^{\\circ}\\). In this case, we use Figure 2.3, and we have \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} c^2&amp; =&amp; h^2 + (b_1 + b)^2\\ \\ \\ [\\hbox{according to TPT}]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 - b_1^2 + b_1^2 +2b_1b +b^2\\ \\ \\ [\\hbox{using TPT again}]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 + 2b_1b\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 + 2a\\cos(\\angle BCD)b\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 + 2a\\cos(180^{\\circ} - C)b\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos C \\end{array} \\] Figure 2.3: Figure for Case 2. Case 3: \\(C&lt;90^{\\circ}\\). In this case, we use Figure 2.4, and we have \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} c^2&amp;=&amp; h^2 + b_2^2\\ \\ \\ [\\hbox{according to TPT}]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2-b_1^2 + b_2^2\\ \\ \\ [\\hbox{using TPT again}]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + (b_1 +b_2)^2 - 2b_1b_2 - 2b_1^2\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 - 2b_1(b_2+b_1)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 - 2b_1b\\\\ &amp;=&amp;a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos C \\end{array} \\] Figure 2.4: Figure for Case 3. The law of sines For any a triangle \\(ABC\\), it is true that \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B}=\\frac{c}{\\sin C}=\\frac{abc}{2T} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the sides that opposite to angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), respectively; \\(T\\) is the area of the triangle. Proof: This is easy if we have noticed that \\[ T = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C=\\frac{1}{2} ac \\sin B = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A. \\] Heron’s formula For any a triangle \\(ABC\\) it is true that \\[\\begin{equation} T = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(T\\) is the area, \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the three sides (opposite to angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), respectively), \\(s=(a+b+c)/2\\). Proof: Let \\(RHS\\) be the Right-Hand-Side of Equation (2.4). \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} RHS &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{[(b+c)^2-a^2][a^2-(c-b)^2]}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(2bc+2bc\\cos A)(2bc-2bc\\cos A)}\\ \\ \\ [\\hbox{according to the law of cosines}]\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{2}bc\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2A}\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A\\\\ &amp;=&amp;T \\end{array} \\] Similarity between two triangles For any two triangles, say \\(ABC\\) and \\(DEF\\), if \\[ \\angle A = \\angle D, \\ \\angle B = \\angle E,\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\angle C = \\angle F, \\] then \\[ \\frac{AB}{DE}=\\frac{BC}{EF}=\\frac{CA}{FD}. \\] (It’s said that the two angles are similar. See Figure 2.5) Proof: Using the law of sines twice, we have \\[ \\frac{AB}{\\sin C}=\\frac{BC}{\\sin A}, \\] and \\[ \\frac{DE}{\\sin F}=\\frac{EF}{\\sin D}. \\] Next, doing “division”, we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\frac{AB}{\\sin C}}{\\frac{DE}{\\sin F}}=\\frac{\\frac{BC}{\\sin A}}{\\frac{EF}{\\sin D}}. \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] Since \\[ \\angle C = \\angle F\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\angle A=\\angle D, \\] Equation (2.5) can be simplified as \\[ \\frac{AB}{DE}=\\frac{BC}{EF}. \\] In a similar manner, we can show that \\[ \\frac{AB}{DE}=\\frac{CA}{FD}, \\] and the proof is completed.

["tricky-trigonometrics.html", "3 Tricky Trigonometrics 3.1 Basic facts about right triangles 3.2 The six ratios 3.3 Extension", " 3 Tricky Trigonometrics 3.1 Basic facts about right triangles (F1) Theare are infinite right triangles. (F2) Let \\(ABC\\) be a right triangle and \\(\\angle C=90^\\circ\\). It is true that \\[ \\angle A + \\angle B = 90^\\circ. \\] That is to say, once we know a non-right angle (e.g. the smallest angle) in the right triangle, we then know all the three angles. To put this in another way: When we study a right triangle in terms of angles, we only need to pay attention to one of its non-right angle. (F3) For any two right triangles, \\(ABC\\) and \\(DEF\\), they are similar if and only if one non-right angle in \\(ABC\\) is equal to an angle in \\(DEF\\). 3.2 The six ratios Take two right triangles \\(ABC\\) and \\(DEF\\) such that \\[ \\angle C= \\angle F = 90^\\circ\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\angle A =\\angle D = \\theta, \\] where \\(0^\\circ &lt; \\theta &lt; 90^\\circ\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is fixed (e.g. \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\)).
